# The _Scaffolding_ Build Environment

A build environment for C, C++, Objective-C and Swift based projects
relying on [GENie](https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie)
for build project generation.

Integrates:
- genie binaries
- genie base settings (extracted from Bgfx and Bx projects)
- basic project template genie file
- makefile-based scripting hub to trigger project generation and subsequent project builds
